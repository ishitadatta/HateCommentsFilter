# Hate Comments Filter
Hate speech is currently of broad and current interest in the domain of social media. The anonymity and flexibility afforded by the Internet has made it easy for users to communicate in an aggressive manner. And as the amount of online hate speech is increasing, methods that automatically detect hate speech is very much required.  In order to create a hate-speech-detecting algorithm, we have used Python-based NLP machine learning techniques. We collected data (say, the data from a social media site that may have comments / tweets) and trained it. For data collection, we used web crawling. Using the beautifulsoup library , we collected the comments of popular posts on a website. Then, using a NLP (or Natural Language Processing) technique called Tf-Idf vectorization, we extracted keywords that convey importance within hate speech. After collecting all the texts within those tags, we created a hate speech dataset. We used logistic regression to train the computer to classify hate speech using the data extracted.
